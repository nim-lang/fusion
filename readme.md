# Nim Fusion
docs: https://nim-lang.github.io/fusion/theindex.html

Fusion contains Nim modules that are to be bundled with the Nim installation in order to give us something like the "Nim distribution". 
Fusion fullfills multiple purposes: 

* It contains candidates for inclusion into the stdlib. However these modules only move into the stdlib if it 
  makes sense to maintain them with the rest of the core of Nim 
  and currently I cannot imagine why that ever would need to be the case.
* Fusion has a broader perspective about what is considered useful. For example an HTML parser or a simple UI 
  library that doesn't support every OS that Nim itself supports is acceptable for Fusion.
* Fusion aims to be an *immutable* code repository, once a module is included it stays. Like Nim itself, 
  Fusion uses a `.since` annotation. New modules which contain few procs are preferred over larger modules that have 
  more procs.
* Fusion is also a Nimble package and it is compatible with Nim version 1 as well as the latest Nim. 
* Fusion uses semver but does not go beyond major version 1 since it's also about preserving the past. Instead of breaking changes
  for a given module M.nim a module named M2.nim will be introduced. M2.nim can share code with M.nim via Nim's `include` or
  `import export` mechanism in order to fight code duplication.

Fusion is for now an idea about how to grow Nim's ecosystem without the pain points of more traditional approaches. 
Time will tell if the idea is a good one.
